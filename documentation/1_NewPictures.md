# Feature: Church & Pastor Images on Relevant Pages

## Overview
Include two key images:
- Church photo on the home/welcome page
- Pastor & spouse photo on the “About Us” page

These must be present for both German and English pages.

## Goals
- Improve visual identity
- Respect responsive constraints

## Acceptance Criteria
- Church image present on home/welcome in both languages
- Pastor + spouse image on “About Us” in both languages
- Correct alt attributes
- Lazy loading for performance

## Technical Notes
- Place the images under `public/assets/images/`
- Add frontmatter fields (if content is YAML/Markdown driven)
- Use optimized sizes (WebP/AVIF where possible)
