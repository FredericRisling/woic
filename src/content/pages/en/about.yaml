        <li><strong>Helping</strong> people rediscover their true self-image in God</li>

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-400">
        Prayer, Praise &amp; Worship of God Almighty is liberating, because of the pleasure it gives God.
        We believe that worshippers are called to advance God's praise on earth and honor Him through worship,
        for God dwells in the praise of His people.
